Background Story:

- The area the player is in is haunted by a spirit that hates people that become stand still.
It wants everyone to keep physically moving and never stop, only allowing sleep out of exhaustion.

- The reason is actually that the spirit was a person that was left behind by their group and died alone in the swamp,
because it was too slow to keep up with the others.

- Through the magic of the ancient shrine the spirit was able to manifest as a ghost and now haunts the area.
Since it happened to itself it thinks, the fate has to happen to everyone else that is not moving.

- The spirit is not evil, but lost in a twisted mindset to the point where it forces people to move or
make them restless spirits (kill them).

- Revealing and convincing the spirit of the truth and its twisted mindset is the key to breaking the curse.
As it can then pass on and leave this world.

- The ancient shrine in the past was used from druids which would come and get one with the spirit world,
but in order to do so the person had to have a clear and unsettled mind.
As a side effect dying nearby the shrine would bind spirits that have no clear mind to not be able to pass on until,
 they cleared their minds of desire and thoughts. At which point they would be in between the spirit and the real realm.

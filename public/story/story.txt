General Storyline:
Prologue: The Awakening
The player wakes up in a dense, unfamiliar forest (The Lost Forest), with no memory of how they got there.
The only thing they know for sure is the overwhelming need to run.
Every fiber of their being tells them that they are being hunted, though by what, they cannot recall.
As they begin to explore, they find their path blocked by thick underbrush, forcing them to choose a direction.

Chapter 1: The Chase Begins
After some exploration, the player stumbles upon an Abandoned Cabin.
The cabin, though empty, feels eerily familiar.
Inside, they find a few remnants of its previous occupants—cryptic notes that speak of a malevolent force in the woods.
A crude map on the wall suggests the existence of other locations, sparking the need to explore further.
But the moment of rest is short-lived, as the player hears something—an unnatural sound—outside, urging them to run again.

Chapter 2: The Descent
The path from the cabin leads into a Murky Swamp.
Here, the player must carefully navigate the treacherous terrain.
The swamp is a labyrinth, and the more they try to find their way through,
the deeper they seem to sink into the muck, both literally and metaphorically.
The sense of being chased becomes almost palpable, with distant splashes and eerie sounds growing closer.
The player must keep moving, always running to avoid being caught.

Chapter 3: The Narrow Escape
The swamp eventually gives way to a Riddle Bridge, a precarious crossing over a deep chasm.
The player must solve a puzzle to proceed, all while feeling the hot breath of whatever is chasing them on their neck.
The tension peaks here as the player has to balance solving the riddle with the primal urge to run.
The bridge creaks ominously with every step, threatening to give way at any moment.

Chapter 4: The Haunting
On the other side of the bridge lies a Ruined Village.
The village is a desolate, forgotten place, with dilapidated buildings and the faint echoes of lives once lived.
The player explores the ruins, finding more clues about the force that hunts them—a recurring theme of people running but never escaping.
As they explore, they realize the village may have once been their own, though their memory remains frustratingly unclear.
The player must continue onward, driven by the need to understand their predicament and the ever-present fear of what’s behind them.

Chapter 5: The Revelation
From the village, the player spots a Watchtower.
Climbing the tower, they get a rare moment of clarity, surveying the surrounding land.
The sight triggers fragmented memories—a flash of a nightmarish chase, an endless cycle of running.
The player realizes they’ve been here before, maybe many times, always running but never escaping.
The tower points them toward the final location, an ancient shrine deep in the forest.

Chapter 6: The Final Confrontation
The player reaches The Cursed Shrine, an ancient place of power buried deep in the woods. The shrine exudes a malevolent aura, and the player understands that this is the source of the curse that has trapped them in this nightmare. Here, they confront the entity that has been hunting them—an embodiment of their fears, a twisted reflection of themselves, or perhaps something even more sinister. The player is given a choice: confront the entity or flee.

If they confront it: The player has a chance to break the cycle, though it comes at a great cost. The shrine’s power is overwhelming, and while they may win, the victory may be Pyrrhic, or they might be pulled back into the cycle.

If they flee: The player finds themselves running once again, only to wake up in the same forest clearing where they started, as if no time has passed. The nightmare continues.

Epilogue: The Loop
Whether they chose to confront the entity or flee, the player finds themselves back where they started, in the same forest, with the same urgent need to run. The realization dawns that they are trapped in an endless loop—always running, never truly escaping. The final scene mirrors the beginning, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the story and leaving the player with a haunting question: Can they ever break free, or are they doomed to run forever?

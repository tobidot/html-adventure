                With the mousewheel, or holding down the right mouse button, you can switch between 4 types of actions to perform on the hovered object.
                - Interact
                - Inspect
                - Pick Up
                - Talk
                "Interact" is the default action and will sometimes be shown as a different icon to indicate what the action will actually trigger.
                For example walking to some other area is often indicated by an arrow pointing in the direction the player will walk.

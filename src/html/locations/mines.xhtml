Though the details are obscured by shadows and distance, the viewer can sense the vastness of the underground maze awaiting exploration. To the left of the tunnel entrance, a cluster of small huts can be seen. These huts serve as a base of operations for the miners, providing shelter, storage for supplies, and a place to rest between shifts.

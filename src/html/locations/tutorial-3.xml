                Objects that you picked up appear in the inventory, you can open the inventory by pressing "I" or "Control",
                or by clicking on the button in the bottom right.
                In the inventory you can interact with them like before,
                the "pick up" action in this context turns into an attempt to use the item on something else.

                At some point in the game you will reveal a map of the area to fast travel to certain points.
                Use the keys "M", "Alt", or the button that will appear at the bottom right to access it.
                You can only travel places you have already been to.

                In case you are stuck or fed up searching the entire screen for objects to interact with.
                Holding down the "Shift"-key will highlight all areas that area interactable in red.

                If you want to speed up things, you can hit "Spacebar" or click anywhere, to cut off some audio or some animations,
                for example when going to another scene.
